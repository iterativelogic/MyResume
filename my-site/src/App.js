            description="Plex Industrial IoT is a platform where we enable industrial assets to send their sensor data to our system for performance monitoring. The application constantly ingests sensor data using Kafka, performs stream processing and stores data in a timeseries database called Apache Druid. Through stream processing, we enable features such as machine maintenance status, generate notifications and alarms. Apache druid is used to create various type of analytics report based on historical data as well as for real time data aggregation. The solution was created as microservice architecture divided as front-api, ingest-api, stream-processor, reporting-api and exhaust-api. The application was deployed on Kubernetes cluster with flux taking care of automatic deployment whenever new image was being pushed to Azure Container Registry (ACR) by Azure DevOps pipeline."
